# Journal — 9-20-2025 — DAY 2

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- I learned how to encode the script to clean the raw data
- I learned how to create a dimension  and fact table (descriptive)
- I learned how to properly do join
- Testing & Quality Checks – Implement unit tests for transformations.
- Testing & Quality Checks- Add data validation (row counts, null checks, schema checks).

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **term** — my definition
- dim - dimension table (descriptive)
- fact- fact table ((numeric, event)

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- No man is an island!

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- For an example exercise, I was tasked to code the visualization for the business question: Which employee generates the most quaterly revenue? I check the attributes of all the table to check if there are relationship to answer the question. 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- Is the script for all the steps (ingestion -> cleaning -> metabase) considered as parameterize scripts? or should it be parameterize script?
- 

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] more practice on the processes: ingestion -> cleaning -> moving to mart.
- [ ] undertand the meaning of scripts
- [ ] understand the meaning of each code

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- https://dataengineering.ph/

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
Its been rough sessions for me, been struggeling to understand what is the purpose  and how to do each step. But every question asked led to undertanding. 

I'm surprised at how cool git is!


### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
