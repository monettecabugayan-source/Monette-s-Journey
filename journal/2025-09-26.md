# Journal — 9-20-2025 — DAY 2

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- I learned how to encode the script to clean the raw data
- I learned how to create a dimension  and fact table (descriptive)
- I learned how to properly do join
- Testing & Quality Checks – Implement unit tests for transformations.
- Testing & Quality Checks- Add data validation (row counts, null checks, schema checks).

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **term** — my definition
- dim - dimension table (descriptive)
- fact- fact table ((numeric, event)

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- No man is an island!

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- Decision: Use the sales and employee-related tables to determine quarterly revenue by employee.

- Why: These tables contain transaction details (revenue) and the employee identifiers needed to answer the question.

- Alternatives: Could have used only the invoices table without joining employees, but that would not attribute revenue to specific staff.

- Trade-off: More joins mean slightly more complexity in the query, but this provides a more accurate view of revenue by employee.

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- Is the script for all the steps (ingestion -> cleaning -> metabase) considered as parameterize scripts? or should it be parameterize script?
- Do we need to learn how to code in order to ingest data or create a pipeline?
- Why do we need dbt if we can also transform data in DBeaver?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ ] more practice on the processes: ingestion -> cleaning -> moving to mart.
- [ ] undertand the meaning of scripts
- [ ] understand the meaning of each code

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- https://dataengineering.ph/

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
It’s been a rough set of sessions for me, as I’ve been struggling to understand the purpose and process of each step. However, every question I asked helped me build a better understanding. I’m still learning, but I can see my progress. I also realized that collaboration with my groupmates plays a big role in clarifying confusing parts. The exercises showed me that trial and error is part of the learning process. Moving forward, I feel more confident that I can handle the challenges with more patience and consistency.



### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
